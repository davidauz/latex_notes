\item A speedboat has an acceleration of 2 $\frac{m}{s^2}$.  \label{ex_f_1} 

What would the final velocity of the speedboat be after 5 seconds if the initial velocity of the speedboat is 4 $\frac{m}{s}$?

\item A vehicle has an acceleration of 5 $\frac{m}{s^2}$. \label{ex_f_2} 

What would the final velocity of the vehicle be after 10 seconds if the initial velocity of the vehicle is 20 $\frac{m}{s}$?

What is the displacement of the vehicle during the 10 $s$ time interval?

\item A child on a toboggan starts from rest and accelerates down a snow-covered hill at 0.8$\frac{m}{s^2}$.  \label{ex_f_3} 

How long does it take the child to reach the bottom of the hill if it is 25.0 m away?

\item  A car accelerates uniformly from a velocity of 21.8 $\frac{m}{s}$ to a velocity of 27.6 $\frac{m}{s}$. \label{ex_f_4} 

The car travels 36.5 m during this acceleration.


What was the acceleration of the car?


Determine the time interval over which this acceleration occurred.

\item A motorcycle starts from rest and accelerates at +2.50 $\frac{m}{s^2}$ for a distance of 150.0 m. \label{ex_f_5} 



It then slows down with an acceleration of â€“1.50 $\frac{m}{s^2}$ until the velocity is +10.0 m/s.

Determine the total displacement of the motorcycle.
