If there were no gravity, in $1.5$ seconds the ball would have a displacement of
magnitude $12 \cdot 1.5$, that is $18 m$, at $70\circ$ to the horizontal.

This is represented by the arrow $\overrightarrow{OA}$ in the figure.

\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{ex_p_1.pdf}
\end{figure}

To this must be added a displacement of magnitude 

\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{2}\cdot 10 \cdot 1.5m^2
\end{equation*}

that is $11.25 m$, vertically downwards, represented by the arrow AB.

The sum of these is the displacement OB.

So after 1.5 seconds the ball is at B.

These diagrams were produced by superimposing several diagrams like
those in exercise \ref{ex_p_1}, but at intervals of $0.5s$ that is for

\begin{equation*}
t=0.5,1,1.5,\ldots,n
\end{equation*}


The displacements $\vec{u}t$ in these times have magnitudes $9 m$, $18 m$, $\ldots$.

The vertical displacements have magnitudes $1.25 m$, $5 m$, $11.25 m$, $\ldots$

The points corresponding to $A$ and $B$ at time $t$ are denoted by $At$ and $Bt$.

You can now show the paths by drawing smooth curves through the points $O$,
$B_{0.5}, B_{1}, \ldots$
for the two initial velocities.

It is simplest to take the origin at ground level, rather than at the point
from which the ball is served, so add 2 to the $y$-coordinate given by the
general formula. 

If the initial speed of the ball is $p\frac{m}{s}$,


\begin{equation*}
x = pt \textrm{ and }y = 2 - 5t^2
\end{equation*}

Both conditions involve both the $x$- and $y$-coordinates, and the time $t$ is
used as the link.

The ball passes over the net when $12 = pt$, that is $t=\frac{12}{p}$

The value of $y$ is then

\begin{equation*}
2-5\left(
\frac{12}{p}
\right)=2-\frac{720}{p^2}
\end{equation*}

and this must be more than $0.9$, so 

\begin{equation*}
2-\frac{720}{p^2} > 0.9
\end{equation*}

This gives

\begin{equation*}
\frac{720}{p^2} <1.1
\end{equation*}


\begin{equation*}
p>\sqrt{\frac{720}{1.1}}\approx25.6
\end{equation*}

Considering the second constraint: the ball lands when $y = 0$, that is when 
$2 - 5t^2 = 0$, or 


\begin{equation*}
t=\sqrt{\frac{2}{5}}
\end{equation*}

It has then gone a horizontal distance of $p\sqrt{\frac{2}{5}}$
metres, and to satisfy the second condition you need $p\sqrt{\frac{2}{5}} < 18$.

This gives 



\begin{equation*}
p<18\sqrt{\frac{5}{2}}\approx 28.5
\end{equation*}


So the ball can be hit with any speed between about $25.6 \frac{m}{s}$
and
$28.5\frac{m}{s}$

Known variables:

\begin{itemize}
\item[$s$] = $1.25m$
\item[$a$] = $9.81\frac{m}{s}$
\item[$u$] = 0
\item[$t$] = ?
\end{itemize}

The equations linking those variables are:


\setcounter{equation}{0}
\begin{equation}
s=ut+\frac{1}{2}at^2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation*}
s=\frac{1}{2}gt^2
\end{equation*}



\begin{equation*}
t=\sqrt{\frac{2s}{g}}
\end{equation*}


\begin{equation*}
t=\sqrt{
\frac{
2\cdot 1.25
}{
9.81
}
}=0.5s
\end{equation*}

Now consider the horizontal motion.

\begin{itemize}
\item[$s$] = $10m$
\item[$a$] = $0$
\item[$t$] = 0.5s
\item[$u$] = ?
\end{itemize}



\begin{equation*}
\textrm{velocity}
=\frac{
\textrm{displacement}
}{
\textrm{time}
}
\end{equation*}



\begin{equation*}
v=\frac{10}{0.5}=20\frac{m}{s}
\end{equation*}
