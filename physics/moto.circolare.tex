In the system shown above, the block of mass $M_1$, is on a rough horizontal table.

The string that attaches it to the block of mass $M_2$ passes over a frictionless pulley of negligible mass.

The coefficient of kinetic friction $\mu_k$ between $M_1$ and the table is less than the coefficient of static friction $\mu_s$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item On the diagram below, draw and identify all the forces acting on the block of mass $M_1$
\begin{figure}[h]

\end{figure}
\item In terms of $M_1$ and $M_2$ determine the minimum value of $\mu_s$ that will prevent the blocks from moving

\vspace{1cm}
The blocks are set in motion by giving $M_2$ a momentary downward push.  In terms of $M_1$, $M_2$, $\mu_k$ and $g$, determine each of the following:

\item The magnitude of the acceleration of $M_1$
